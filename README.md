The **Front-End Checklist** is an exhaustive list of all elements you need to have / to test before launching your site / HTML page to production.

It is based on Front-End developers' years of experience, with the additions coming from some other open-source checklists.

## Table of Contents

1. **[Head](#head)**
2. **[HTML](#html)**
3. **[Webfonts](#webfonts)**
4. **[CSS](#css)**
5. **[Images](#images)**
6. **[JavaScript](#javascript)**
7. **[Security](#security)**
8. **[Performance](#performance-1)**
9. **[Accessibility](#accessibility)**
10. **[SEO](#seo)**

## How to use?

All items in the **Front-End Checklist** are required for the majority of the projects, but some elements can be omitted or are not essential (in the case of an administration web app, you may not need RSS feed for example). We choose to use 3 levels of flexibility:

* ![Low][low_img] means that the item is **recommended** but can be omitted in some particular situations.
* ![Medium][medium_img] means that the item is **highly recommended** and can eventually be omitted in some really particular cases. Some elements, if omitted, can have bad repercussions in terms of performance or SEO.
* ![High][high_img] means that the item **can't be omitted** by any reason. You may cause a dysfunction in your page or have accessibility or SEO issues. The testing priority needs to be on these elements first.

Some resources possess an emoticon to help you understand which type of content / help you may find on the checklist:

* ðŸ“–: documentation or article
* ðŸ› : online tool / testing tool
* ðŸ“¹: media or video content

## Head

> **Notes:** You can find [a list of everything](https://github.com/joshbuchea/HEAD) that could be found in the `<head>` of an HTML document.

### Meta tag

* [ ] **Doctype:** ![High][high_img] The Doctype is HTML5 and is at the top of all your HTML pages.

```html
<!-- Doctype HTML5 -->
<!doctype html>
```

> * ðŸ“– [Determining the character encoding - HTML5 W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#determining-the-character-encoding)

*The next 3 meta tags (Charset, X-UA Compatible and Viewport) need to come first in the head.*

* [ ] **Charset:** ![High][high_img] The charset declared (UTF-8) is declared correctly.

```html
<!-- Set character encoding for the document -->
<meta charset="utf-8">
```

* [ ] **X-UA-Compatible:** ![Medium][medium_img] The X-UA-Compatible meta tag is present.

```html
<!-- Instruct Internet Explorer to use its latest rendering engine -->
<meta http-equiv="x-ua-compatible" content="ie=edge">

```html
<!-- Viewport for responsive web design -->
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```

* [ ] **Title:** ![High][high_img] A title is used on all pages (SEO: Google calculate the pixel width of the characters used in the title, cut off between 472 and 482 pixels. Average character limit would be around 55-characters).

```html
<!-- Standard favicon -->

## Accessibility

> **Notes:** You can watch the playlist [A11ycasts with Rob Dodson](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNYkxOF6rcICWx0C9LVWWVqvHlYJyqw7g) ðŸ“¹

### Best practices

- [ ] **Progressive enhancement:** ![Medium][medium_img] Major functionality like main navigation and search should work without JavaScript enabled.

> * ðŸ“– [Enable / Disable JavaScript in Chrome Developer Tools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBmvq2cE0D8)

- [ ] **Color contrast:** ![Medium][medium_img] Color contrast should at least pass WCAG AA (AAA for mobile).

> * ðŸ›  [Contrast ratio](https://leaverou.github.io/contrast-ratio/)

#### Headings

* [ ] **H1:** ![High][high_img] All pages have an H1 which is not the title of the website.
* [ ] **Headings:** ![High][high_img] Headings should be used properly in the right order (H1 to H6).

> * ðŸ“¹ [Why headings and landmarks are so important -- A11ycasts #18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAAzdi1xuUY&index=9&list=PLNYkxOF6rcICWx0C9LVWWVqvHlYJyqw7g)

#### Landmarks

- [ ] **Role banner:** ![High][high_img] `<header>` has `role="banner"`.
- [ ] **Role navigation:** ![High][high_img] `<nav>` has `role="navigation"`.
- [ ] **Role main:** ![High][high_img] `<main>` has `role="main"`.

> * ðŸ“– [Using ARIA landmarks to identify regions of a page](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/Using_ARIA_landmarks_to_identify_regions_of_a_page)

### Semantics

- [ ] **Specific HTML5 input types are used:** ![Medium][medium_img] This is especially important for mobile devices that show customized keypads and widgets for different types.

> * ðŸ“– [Mobile Input Types](http://mobileinputtypes.com/)

### Form

* [ ] **Label:** ![High][high_img] A label is associated with each input form element. In case a label can't be displayed, use `aria-label` instead.

> * ðŸ“– [Using the aria-label attribute - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_aria-label_attribute)

### Accessibility testing

* [ ] **Accessibility standards testing:** ![High][high_img] Use the WAVE tool to test if your page respects the accessibility standards.

> * ðŸ›  [Wave testing](http://wave.webaim.org/)

* [ ] **Keyboard navigation:** ![High][high_img] Test your website using only your keyboard in a previsible order. All interactive elements are reachable and usable.
* [ ] **Screen-reader:** ![Medium][medium_img] All pages were tested in a screen-reader (VoiceOver, ChromeVox, NVDA or Lynx).
* [ ] **Focus style:** ![High][high_img] If the focus is disabled, it is replaced by visible state in CSS.

> * ðŸ“¹ [Managing Focus - A11ycasts #22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srLRSQg6Jgg&index=5&list=PLNYkxOF6rcICWx0C9LVWWVqvHlYJyqw7g)
